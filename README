    This is used to secure the cookies. Encryption keys and message
    authentication keys are derived from this using one-way functions.
    Changing it will invalidate all sessions.

    Number of seconds for which the session may be considered valid. If
    cookie_duration is not set, this is used instead to expire the session
    after a period of time, regardless of the length of the browser
    session. It is unset by default, meaning that sessions expiration is
    not capped.

SYNOPSIS

      # In Dancer 2 config.yml file
    
      session: Cookie
      engines:
        session:
          Cookie:
            secret_key: your secret passphrase
            default_duration: 604800

DESCRIPTION

    This module implements a session factory for Dancer 2 that stores
    session state within a browser cookie. Features include:

      * Data serialization and compression using Sereal

      * Data encryption using AES with a unique derived key per cookie

      * Enforced expiration timestamp (independent of cookie expiration)

      * Cookie integrity protected with a message authentication code (MAC)

    See Session::Storage::Secure for implementation details and important
    security caveats.

SEE ALSO

    CPAN modules providing cookie session storage (possibly for other
    frameworks):

      * Dancer::Session::Cookie -- Dancer 1 equivalent to this module

      * Catalyst::Plugin::CookiedSession -- encryption only

      * HTTP::CryptoCookie -- encryption only

      * Mojolicious::Sessions -- MAC only

      * Plack::Middleware::Session::Cookie -- MAC only

      * Plack::Middleware::Session::SerializedCookie -- really just a
      framework and you provide the guts with callbacks

      * Dancer2::Core::Role::SessionFactory -- documentation of the base
      package, some more attributes to configure the cookie
