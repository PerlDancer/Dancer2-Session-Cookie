=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Session::Cookie - Dancer 2 session storage in secure cookies

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # In Dancer 2 config.yml file

  session: Cookie
  engines:
    session:
      Cookie:
        secret_key: your secret passphrase
        default_duration: 604800

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a session factory for Dancer 2 that stores session state
within a browser cookie.  Features include:

=over 4

=item *

Data serialization and compression using L<Sereal>

=item *

Data encryption using AES with a unique derived key per cookie

=item *

Enforced expiration timestamp (independent of cookie expiration)

=item *

Cookie integrity protected with a message authentication code (MAC)

=back

See L<Session::Storage::Secure> for implementation details and important
security caveats.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 secret_key (required)

This is used to secure the cookies.  Encryption keys and message authentication
keys are derived from this using one-way functions.  Changing it will
invalidate all sessions.

=head2 default_duration

Number of seconds for which the session may be considered valid.  If
C<cookie_duration> is not set, this is used instead to expire the session after
a period of time, regardless of the length of the browser session.  It is
unset by default, meaning that sessions expiration is not capped.
